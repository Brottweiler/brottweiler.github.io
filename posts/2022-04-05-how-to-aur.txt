In the early days, I used Yaourt[0] like anybody else. It was very
convenient, and for some reason I stopped using it. Today, no one should
use it, but people use other helpers[1] very similar to it.

Most helpers, at least if they are wrappers for pacman[2], encourages
bad practices. I have used some helpers mainly for searching the AUR
from the command line, but also downloading and updating.
Nowadays, I manually download/clone the AUR repo, build and install
using pacman. I only used cower[3] for checking updates until I switched
to perl-checkupdates-aur[4], until I noticed it stopped working for me.

Trying to find a solution, I realised that my old AUR account didn't
have the 'Notify of package updates' option enabled. This option is
enabled for new accounts, but my account is old. Now I get updates via
email, and I can `git pull` to update and rebuild the package.

If you want to avoid AUR helpers, here are my steps.
	1. Create a folder where you can store your packages and enter it.
	2. Clone the package using git.
	3. Read the PKGBUILD (and other files) and build the package.
	4. Install the package (or use -i with makepkg).
	5. Create an AUR account and enable notifications.

Now you should get notifications via email if a package updates, and you
can `git pull` to update.
If you _really_ need an AUR helper.. look into aurutils[5].

If you want to simplify your git cloning, add this to your `.gitconfig`.

	[url "https://aur.archlinux.org/"]
		insteadOf = "aur:"
	[url "ssh+git://aur.archlinux.org/"]
		pushInsteadOf = "aur:"

Now you can clone the package using `git clone aur:<pkg name>`.
