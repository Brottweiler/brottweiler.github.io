The best way to reach me is via email. I also hang around IRC, so if you want
to chat, please email me and we can meet on IRC.

For personal inquiries, please email me at <me@brottsie.eu>. If your issue is
regarding Project Enyo <projectenyo.eu>, please email me at
<brott@projectenyo.eu>. If you want to reach all staff, not just me, there is
the email address <info@projectenyo.eu> for that.

If you come from the oc.tc Minecraft server, then you should email me at
<brott@oc.tc> to reach me.

Please use the correct address! :-)
